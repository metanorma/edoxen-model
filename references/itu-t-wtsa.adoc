The World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly (Hammamet, 2016),
considering

pursuant to
a)	Resolution 166 (Rev. Busan, 2014) of the Plenipotentiary Conference, on the number of vice-chairmen of Sector advisory groups, study groups and other groups;

c)	the convenience of nominating by consensus up to two candidates per region as vice-chairmen of the advisory group;

2	that candidates for the posts of study group chairmen and vice-chairmen and candidates for the posts of chairman and vice-chairmen of TSAG should be identified, taking into account that, for each study group and for TSAG, WTSA will appoint the chairman and only the number of vice-chairmen deemed necessary for the efficient and effective management and functioning of the group in question, applying the guidelines given in Annex C;
3	that nominations for the posts of study group chairmen and vice‑chairmen or for the posts of chairman and vice‑chairmen of TSAG should be accompanied by a biographical profile highlighting the qualifications of the individuals proposed, taking into careful consideration continuity in participation in ITU‑T study groups or TSAG, and that the Director of the Telecommunication Standardization Bureau will circulate the profiles to the heads of delegation present at WTSA;
4	that the term of office for both chairmen and vice-chairmen should not exceed two terms of office between consecutive assemblies;
5	that the term of office in one appointment (e.g. as a vice-chairman) does not count towards the term of office for another appointment (e.g. as a chairman) and that steps should be taken to provide some continuity between chairmen and vice-chairmen;
6	that the interval between assemblies during which a chairman or vice-chairman is elected under No. 244 of the Convention does not count towards the term of office,
resolves further
1	that vice-chairmen of TSAG and study groups should be encouraged to assume the leadership role of activities in order to ensure equitable distribution of tasks and to achieve greater involvement by the vice-chairmen in the management and work of TSAG and the study groups;
2	that the appointment of vice-chairmen of study groups should be limited to three candidates from each region, taking into account Resolution 70 (Rev. Busan, 2014) and resolves 2 of Resolution 58 (Rev. Busan, 2014), to ensure equitable geographical distribution among the ITU regions so as to ensure that every region is represented by not more than three competent and qualified candidates,
invites Member States and Sector Members
1	to support their successful candidates for such posts in ITU‑T, and support and facilitate their task during their term of office;
2	to promote the nomination of women candidates for the posts of chairmen and vice-chairmen of the ITU‑T study groups and for the posts of chairman and vice-chairmen of TSAG.
