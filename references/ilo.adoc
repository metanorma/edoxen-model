The General Conference of the International Labour Organization,

Recognizing that the high incidence of the informal economy in all its aspects is a major challenge for the rights of workers, including the fundamental principles and rights at work, and for social protection, decent working conditions, inclusive development and the rule of law, and has a negative impact on the development of sustainable enterprises, public revenues and governments’ scope of action, particularly with regard to economic, social and environmental policies, the soundness of institutions and fair competition in national and international markets, and
Acknowledging that most people enter the informal economy not by choice but as a consequence of a lack of opportunities in the formal economy and in the absence of other means of livelihood, and
Recalling that decent work deficits – the denial of rights at work, the absence of sufficient opportunities for quality employment, inadequate social protection and the absence of social dialogue – are most pronounced in the informal economy, and
Acknowledging that informality has multiple causes, including governance and structural issues, and that public policies can speed up the process of transition to the formal economy, in a context of social dialogue, and
Recalling the Declaration of Philadelphia, 1944, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its Follow-up, 1998, and the ILO Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization, 2008, and
Reaffirming the relevance of the eight ILO fundamental Conventions and other relevant international labour standards and United Nations instruments as listed in the Annex, and
Recalling the resolution and Conclusions concerning decent work and the informal economy adopted by the International Labour Conference at its 90th Session (2002), and other relevant resolutions and Conclusions as listed in the Annex, and
Affirming that the transition from the informal to the formal economy is essential to achieve inclusive development and to realize decent work for all, and
Recognizing the need for Members to take urgent and appropriate measures to enable the transition of workers and economic units from the informal to the formal economy, while ensuring the preservation and improvement of existing livelihoods during the transition, and
Recognizing that employers’ and workers’ organizations play an important and active role in facilitating the transition from the informal to the formal economy, and
Having decided upon the adoption of certain proposals with regard to the transition from the informal to the formal economy, which is the fifth item on the agenda of the session, and
Having determined that these proposals shall take the form of a Recommendation;
