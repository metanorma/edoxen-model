= Edoxen information models

== Purpose

Different organizations utilize different resolution and decision
structures but are similar in purpose as well as in data elements
provided.

The Edoxen information models aim to unify those data elements in
a common framework, allowing interoperability between and creation
of references to resolutions and decisions.


== Applicability

This data model fully covers the resolution structures of a
number of bodies, including:

* ISO, ISO/TMB
* ITU-T
* ITU-D
* WTSA
* BIPM / CGPM
* OIML
* ILO


== Information model

The information models are in the https://github.com/lutaml/lutaml[LutaML UML]
format.

See the `models/` directory.


== YAML representation

=== Resolution collection

The YAML representation of the data model is as follows.
